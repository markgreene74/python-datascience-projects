## generate-covid-visualization

Fetch the latest data about COVID-19 deaths from the EU Open Data Portal, process the data and save the visualization in two different formats (.png, .pdf). The filenames will reflect the date of when the data was last processed.

### Usage:

Use `./build.sh` to create the image `generate-covid-visualization` from the `Dockerfile`.

Use `./run.sh` to generate the `png` and `pdf` file that contain the visualization.
